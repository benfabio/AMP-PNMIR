### AMP-PNMIR phytoplankton and zooplankton data
R codes developed during my postdoc at UMR 7093-LOV (2017) funded by the "Parc Naturel Marin de la Mer d'Iroise"

### 04/12/2020
Here, I deposit the main scripts developed during my contract (2017) and used to prepare and analyze various types of data under the R coding environment.
I selected the R scripts that are key to reproduce the results published in: 
- Benedetti, F., Jalabert, L., Sourisseau, M., Becker, B., Cailliau, C., Desnos, C., . . . Pouline, P. (2019). The Seasonal and Inter-Annual Fluctuations of Plankton Abundance and Community Structure in a North Atlantic Marine Protected Area. Frontiers in Marine Science, 6(214). doi:10.3389/fmars.2019.00214

I acknowledge these R scripts are not commented in the most detailed fashion. I did not know how to use Git and GitHub backed then.
Feel free to contact me at: fabio.benedetti@usys.ethz.ch or fabio.benedetti@unibe.ch if you need further information.
